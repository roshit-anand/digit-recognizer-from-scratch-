# Neural Networks from scratch

There are 2 models :
 
  1.Simple fully connected nural network without any hidden layer with a softmax as activation function and a normal gradient backpropagation on mnist dataset 
 
  2.Second model is a fully connected neural network with 2 hidden layers (784>512>128>10) with relu activation for first and second hidden layer and softmax activation function     at last layer with adam gradient decent for backpropagation 
  
LIBRARIES NEEDED 
  
  1.idx2numpy(for reading the dataset manually, can be ignored and keras can be used to import dataset)
  
  2.numpy
  
  3.matplotlib
